# Wells Fargo Software Engineering Simulation

## Overview

This project is a part of the Software Engineering Simulation for Wells Fargo's financial portfolio management system. The primary focus areas include:

- **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding relevant requirements for building a robust system to manage financial portfolios.
- **Data Management**: Identifying and tracking the necessary data for the system.
- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Creating a visual representation of the data model.
- **Implementation**: Implementing the ERD using IntelliJ and publishing it to GitHub.

## Development Approach

### Requirements Analysis

The first step involved understanding the relevant requirements needed to build an efficient system for managing financial portfolios. This included comprehending the business logic and necessary functionalities.

### Data Management

The system needed to keep track of various financial data points. We identified the essential data elements and ensured that they were accurately captured and managed.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

A comprehensive ERD was drafted to visually represent the data model. This diagram helped in understanding the relationships between different data entities and ensuring a coherent structure.

### Implementation

The ERD was implemented using the IntelliJ developer application. The implementation process included defining the data entities, their relationships, and the constraints. The final implementation was then published to GitHub for version control and collaboration.
